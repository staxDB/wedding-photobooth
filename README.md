This project was originally developed by **[Philipp Trenz](https://github.com/philipptrenz)**, checkout his amazing project **[photo-booth](https://github.com/philipptrenz/photo-booth)**

Since my photobooth project is based on his code, but has been largely rewritten to add extra functionality, I've started a new project.
The Readme and most of the code is originally based on **[Philipp Trenz](https://github.com/philipptrenz)** code

# additional features 
* live preview (if camera is supported)
* use of IR remote with **[LIRC](http://www.lirc.org/)** based on the node lib **[lircv0.9.4_node
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lircv0.9.4_node)** to remotely trigger an image
* extended config options, either on config file or webapp

## How it works

Simply connect your camera via USB or even via wifi to the computer running this application, for example a **Raspberry Pi**. The app shows a countdown by clicking at the screen (or tapping at a touchscreen), triggers your camera to take a photo, downloads it from your camera, shrinks it to a smaller size and displays it on the screen. First in fullscreen, then added to a gallery of previous taken photos.

photo-booth also provides a web application by running a webserver. Every newly taken photo gets immediately pushed to the webapp. From there it's easy for your guests to download their photos. There's also the option to leave a e-mail address for sending the photos afterwards. You only have to provide a Wi-Fi hotspot.

Because of the use of gphoto2 it works with nearly any camera like plug and play.

## Installation

**HINT** To use gphoto2 on raspberry pi 3b+ you need to prohibit auto mount of raspberry, so photo2 can access your camera!

### Remove some files to get gphoto2 working
Raspbian ships with a utility called `gvfs` to allow mounting cameras as virtual file systems.
This enables you to access some camera models as if they were USB storage drives, however, it interferes with our use of the camera, as the operating system then claims exclusive access to the camera.
Thus, we have to disable these functionalities.

*Note: This might break file manager access etc. for some camera models.*

To remove these files, enter the following in a terminal:
```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.gtk.vfs.GPhoto2VolumeMonitor.service
sudo rm /usr/share/gvfs/mounts/gphoto2.mount
sudo rm /usr/share/gvfs/remote-volume-monitors/gphoto2.mount
sudo rm /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor
sudo rm /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-gphoto2
```

You should reboot afterwards to make sure these changes are effective.

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [gphoto2](http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/) installed. 

Before getting started please check [here](#Unsupported-devices) if the hardware you want to use is supported. I tested photo-booth under Ubuntu Linux (64bit), MacOS and Raspbian (Raspberry Pi 3, ARM). Anyway, the documentation here will be focused on Linux based systems. 

**Raspbian STRETCH (with desktop):**

```bash
# Install needed dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git libxss-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3

# Install latest version of libgphoto2, choose last stable release
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater/master/gphoto2-updater.sh && sudo bash gphoto2-updater.sh

# If you are using a Raspberry Pi > 1: Activate hardware acceleration
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dri
sudo su -c 'grep -q -F "dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d" /boot/config.txt || echo "dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d" >> /boot/config.txt'

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/philipptrenz/photo-booth.git && cd photo-booth

# Make the Node installation script executable
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/install_node_v9.sh

# Install node
sudo ./scripts/install_node_v9.sh

# Install
npm install
```

## Run photo-booth

To run photo-booth the following command should do it. To run the webapp on port 80 and for the usage of GPIO pins at the Raspberry Pi root privileges are required.

**Important:** The command needs to be run from a terminal on the GUI, executing via SSH will most likely fail!

```
sudo npm start
```

Basically, it's not a good idea to run a web server as root, if you do not need GPIOs consider setting up a redirect from port 80 to 8080 on your system. That can be achieved by a iptables rule for example. Then you can start photo-booth with

```
npm start
```

**HINT:** The little linux tool `unclutter` can hide the cursor.

## Start photo-booth on boot (for Raspberry Pi)

To start photo-booth on boot add the following line at the end of `/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`:

```
@sudo node /home/pi/photo-booth/scripts/cli.js
```

 
## Configure it

There are a few settings and options that you should take a look at.


### The `config.json`

The project includes a config.json file. There you can set several parameters, e.g. to start in fullscreen or not or if you want to keep your taken photos on your camera.

It looks like this:

```json
{
	"init": {
		"fullscreen": false,
		"width": 1440,
		"height": 900,
		"showDevTools": true,
		"useGPIO": false,
		"useLIRC": false,
		"grayscaleMode": true,
		"preventScreensaver": true
	},
	"maxImageSize": "1100",
	"countdownLength": 5,
	"slideshow": {
		"enabled": true,
		"activatesAfterSeconds": 30,
		"secondsPerImages": 8
	},
	"preview": {
		"enabled": true,
		"activatesAfterSeconds": 0.5,
		"millisecondsPerImages": 40,
		"previewDuration": 10,
		"previewWidth": 600
	},
	"gphoto2": {
		"capturetarget": 1,
		"keep": true
	},
	"content_dir": "../content",
	"temp_dir": "../content",
	"webapp": {
		"password": "test",
		"maxDownloadImageSize": 800,
		"enableRemoteRelease": true
	},
	"branding": {
		"type": "text",
		"content": "<div style='font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 25px;'><i class='fa fa-wifi' aria-hidden='true' style='font-size: 2.5em;'></i> <b style='font-size: 2em; padding-left: 15px;'>photo-booth</b><br /><p>Log into wifi, browse to <b style='padding: 0 5px;'>photo.app</b> and download your photos!</p></div>",
		"position": "bottomleft"
	}
}
```

Best way to modify the `config.json` is by copying it to `my.config.json`, photo-booth will prefer the latter one:
```
cp config.json my.config.json
```


Some notes:

* Images get shrinked after got downloaded from the camera, set the size with maxImageSize
* You have to figure out the captureTarget of your camera. Even if you choose to keep images at the camera, if gphoto2 chooses to store by default to the RAM of your camera, images get deleted when camera get turned off. Figure out the right captureTarget by running `gphoto2 --get-config=capturetarget`, then choose something should named sd card or so. This should be your first try if a photo gets taken, but it won't show up at the screen.
* If you want to keep images on camera, set `keep` to `true`
* The errorMessage is pure HTML, just fill in whatever you want
* The `content_dir` is the path to store the photos to. For storing images on usb device, change this path to `/media/pi/<NAME_OF_USB_DEVICE>`
* The `temp_dir` is the path to store the preview image. It's recommended to choose a local path to get a more fluent preview.

### How to use the integrated webapp

As mentioned above photo-booth has a built in web page where images can be downloaded. 

For an easy way to use it, start a open wifi hotspot on the computer photo-booth runs on. If you use a Raspberry Pi, there're enough tutorials out there to figure it out (i.e. [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md)). Then connect your device, e.g. a smartphone, with the wifi, open your browser and type in the ip address of the Pi. More elegant is it to configure a DNS redirect so the users can type in a web address like "photo.app", therefore I use `dnsmasq` which is also configured as DHCP server.

To realize a dns redirect, edit the 'dnsmasq.conf' file located at '/etc/dnsmasq.conf' like this:

```
interface=wlan0      # Use the require wireless interface - usually wlan0
  dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.100,255.255.255.0,24h
address=/photo.app/192.168.4.1      # Dns redirect to the app
```

## Use a push button to trigger photos

You can connect a physical push button to the GPIO Pins of your Pi to trigger photos!

Therefore activate the GPIOs by setting `"useGPIO": true` in config.json. Then connect the first port of the push button to the ground pin of your Pi, second to GPIO 3 (PIN 5) and to a resistor of about 10k-100kÎ©, the other end of the resistor to 3.3V (e.g. PIN 1). That's all!

**Make sure you run the application as root (`sudo npm start`), GPIOs need root privileges.**

## Use a ir remote button to trigger photos

For this project i used the following ir receiver and remote:

* [IR Receiver *Link to Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00PJ80S14/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) IR Receiver IR-EmpfÃ¤nger TSOP4838 38kHz

First you have to initialize a custom remote with lirc. I'm using the Raspberry Pi 3b+ so I used this tutorial to add a custom remote:

**IMPORTANT:** When creating a custom remote, you'll be asked to give it a name. Insert 'photobooth' to use it later in the photobooth-app!

(https://gist.github.com/prasanthj/c15a5298eb682bde34961c322c95378b)
```
Notes to make IR shield (made by LinkSprite) work in Raspberry Pi 3 (bought from Amazon [1]). 
The vendor has some documentation [2] but that is not complete and sufficient for Raspbian Stretch. 
Following are the changes that I made to make it work.

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install lirc

# Add the following lines to /etc/modules file
lirc_dev
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=17

# Add the following lines to /etc/lirc/hardware.conf file
LIRCD_ARGS="--uinput --listen"
LOAD_MODULES=true
DRIVER="default"
DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
MODULES="lirc_rpi"

# Update the following line in /boot/config.txt
dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=17

# Update the following lines in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
driver    = default
device    = /dev/lirc0

$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start

# Check status to make lirc is running
$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd status

# Reboot before testing
$ sudo reboot

# To test if lirc driver is working
$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
$ mode2 -d /dev/lirc0
<press a key in remote and you should see multple lines like below>
pulse 560
space 1706
pulse 535

# to record a custom remote/register a remote device
$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
$ sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/lircd.conf
# follow the instruction prompted by the above command carefully

################################  hint  ################################
in my case the lircd.conf file was renamed by the name of the remote I setted in the instructions, 
(in my case '~/photobooth.lircd.conf')
You should also name the key to generate 'KEY_0', because the photobooth app will listen on this key!
########################################################################################

# at the end ~/lircd.conf file will be generated (in my case '~/photobooth.lircd.conf')

# backup the original lircd.conf
$ sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd_original.conf
$ sudo cp ~/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf 
--> in my case: 
$ sudo cp ~/photobooth.lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf 

$ sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start
```

To test that your custom remote works, enter  
```
irw
```

You should see results like this:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ irw
0000000000000001 00 KEY_0 photobooth
0000000000000001 01 KEY_0 photobooth
0000000000000001 00 KEY_0 photobooth
0000000000000001 01 KEY_0 photobooth
0000000000000001 00 KEY_0 photobooth
0000000000000001 01 KEY_0 photobooth
```

in a terminal and click the button of the remote. If you receive signals, you're done!

For some reason the node package for lyrc is not installed by npm install, so install it manually:

```
cd ~
cd photo-booth/
npm i lircv0.9.4_node
```
afterwards you should be able to use the remote in the photobooth app.

**HINT** The app will listen for KEY_0 on the 'photobooth' remote!

## Unsupported devices

Please note that there are several devices which are not supported by photo-booth.

### Unsupported architectures

As Electron, the main framework, besides ia32 (i686) and x64 (amd64) only supports the ARM v7 architecture (and ARM v8 as it is backwards compatible), several ARM devices are not supported. Further information can be found [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#linux). The following ARM devices among others can not be supported:

* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi Zero W / WH 
* Raspberry Pi 1 A / A+
* Raspberry Pi 1 B / B+

### Unsupported cameras

* The Raspberry Pi camera module is not supported
* Webcams (such as those built into your laptop or Logitech USB) are not supported

Also some other DSLR and Compact Cameras are not supported. Please check for your specific model [here](http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php).

## Common issues

If you have any problems, start reading here. If you do not find anything, check under [Issues](https://github.com/philipptrenz/photo-booth/issues), if someone else already had a similar problem. If you still have no solution, open a new issue.

### How to quit photo-booth in fullscreen?

Hit the Escape key to exit the fullscreen mode, then you can close the app.

### Why are all images in grayscale?

Go to `config.json` and change `grayscaleMode` to `false`.

### My camera takes a photo, but it does not show up

This may be related to wrong capture target settings. Run `gphoto2 --get-config capturetarget` from the console, the output looks something like this:

```
Label: Capture Target
Type: RADIO
Current: Internal RAM
Choice: 0 Memory card
Choice: 1 Internal RAM

```
Identify the number of the memory card and change the `captureTarget` property in `config.json`.
